Inspiration
--
Github has saved our lives many times: in case of fire, git add, git commit, git push. But have you ever thought about what your commits say about you? Are you the type who just writes "blabla" all the type or do you give lots of details?

What it does
--
Our app fetches your commits history from github, runs sentiment analysis on it and then based on the result suggests a song to match your mood, using spotify playlists. It also comes with a really cool design. The fun never stops!
